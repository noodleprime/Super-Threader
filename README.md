# SuperThreader
 A flexible multithreading system with Blueprint support
# Implementation
To implement this into your project, simply download the repository and add it to your project's plugins folder. Currently, this project is built for Unreal v5.5. 
# Nodes
All nodes can be found in the "Super Threader" category.
There are four nodes to be used, which are all self explanatory. Start Thread, Stop Thread, Stop All Threads, and Is Thread Running. Starting a thread feeds out an ID variable you can use to track or stop it.
